MONTEGRANDE MANILA, Philippines \u2014 Drivers and operators of buses, jeepneys, and tricycles cannot afford to wait until the end of the May elections to receive fuel subsidies from the government, Sen. Grace Poe said on Monday as she lamented the suspension of the financial assistance due to the public spending ban of the Commission on Elections (Comelec). \u201cWe cannot tell our people to hold on for relief until the elections are over. Hunger simply cannot wait,\u201d the chair of the Senate public services committee said in a statement. ADVERTISEMENT The ban on election spending is in effect from March 25 until May 8, the eve of Election Day. Poe called on the Comelec to act swiftly on the appeal of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for an exemption to allow the agency to resume distribution of cash aid to PUV (public utility vehicle) drivers and operators.FEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO One less Comelec delay: Precinct finder going online NEWSINFO 6 teens dead, 2 others hurt as van plunges into ravine in Mountain Province NEWSINFO Isko Moreno\u2019s acts would have dismayed Roco, ex-partymates say \u201cSince the release of the P3-billion fund, not even half of the identified 377,000 beneficiaries received the assistance, which was handed out only for 10 days before the election ban took effect on March 25,\u201d she said. The LTFRB on Monday said it had given subsidies to 110,287 drivers hit by the fuel price crisis. In March, the LTFRB started distributing P6,500 in fuel aid to some 264,578 qualified PUV drivers to help them cope with runaway fuel price hikes exacerbated by the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict. So far, it has given subsidies to 109,080 jeepney drivers and 1,207 bus drivers. At least 67,447 applications for subsidies are still being reviewed by the board, including those filed by 22,932 taxi drivers. According to LTFRB Executive Director Tina Cassion, they have yet to receive a list of beneficiaries from the Department of the Interior and Local Government regarding tricycle drivers who are qualified for the program. Decision this week Poe said the subsidy program must resume immediately. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cOur PUV drivers and operators have waited long for the cash aid that we have funded in the annual budget to bring succor to our people in times of distress,\u201d she said. On Monday, the Comelec said it would announce on Thursday whether it would exempt the government\u2019s fuel subsidy program for PUV drivers and operators from the election ban on public spending. The poll body took up the LTFRB\u2019s request during its weekly policy meeting on March 30 and required the agency to submit documents to justify exempting the fuel subsidy program from the election ban on public spending. \u201cThis is undergoing study and by Wednesday (April 6) a recommendation will be submitted to the en banc (policy body),\u201d Comelec Commissioner George Garcia said on Monday. \u201cYou can expect by Thursday (April 7), we will announce Comelec\u2019s action on LTFRB\u2019s request,\u201d he said. In a statement, Cassion said the LTFRB had already \u201cpresented justification on its application for exemption\u2026 amid the pressing need to complete the distribution of payouts amid high prices of fuel while assuring the poll body that said distribution will not be used for political gains.\u201d The board is also working on the production of at least 86,000 cards and other preparations for the remaining payables, she added. Earlier, the Comelec exempted the Office of the Vice President\u2019s pandemic relief projects from the election spending ban. The poll body last week also exempted certain projects of the Department of Social Welfare and Development, the Office of the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity, and the provincial government of Davao de Oro. Small relief Meanwhile, motorists got a reprieve this week as oil companies on Tuesday slightly decreased pump prices of petroleum products, a week after implementing a big-time hike. Prices of gasoline and diesel were cut by P2.30 and P1.85 a liter, respectively, while the cost of kerosene fell by P1.65 a liter. This would be the second time this year that oil companies rolled back fuel prices. Prior to this week\u2019s adjustment, diesel and gasoline prices had gone up by P27.85 and P18.30 a liter, respectively. On the global scene, analysts said concerns over tight supply due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the Iran nuclear deal continued to linger despite some countries\u2019 decision to draw oil from their strategic petroleum reserves. US President Joe Biden has authorized the release of more than 180 million barrels of oil from the country\u2019s emergency oil reserve for the next six months. Member countries of the International Energy Agency followed suit. The price of Dubai crude\u2014the Asian bellwether\u2014remained at $110.89 a barrel as of Monday. As oil prices remain high, the government has been asked to ease the impact of rising fuel prices on the country\u2019s agriculture sector by suspending the imposition of the excise on oil.  Rosanna Contreras, president of Soccsksargen Federation of Fishing and Allied Industries Inc., on Monday pushed for the suspension of the excise on petroleum products to ease the burden of consecutive oil price hikes on fishermen. Fuel accounts for 60 to 70 percent of the total fishing cost. Chester Warren Tan, president of the National Federation of Hog Farmers Inc., said the reprieve sought by agricultural producers was temporary. \u201cWhat the industry is asking for is to cancel or lower the tax for three to four months to help us cope with rising fuel costs,\u201d he added. \u2014WITH A REPORT FROM JORDEENE B.

Since local officials may be preoccupied with the election campaign, the Department of the Interior and Local Government is now coordinating with local health authorities to ensure the continuation of mass vaccination, he said. The government may introduce a marketing campaign alongside the inoculation drive to convince more Filipinos to get vaccinated, Densing added. According to him, only around 12 million, mostly from Metro Manila, have availed themselves of booster shots, with the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao having the lowest vaccination coverage in the country.

Last month, most of the foreign visitors were from the United States (603), followed by the United Kingdom (211), United Arab Emirates (201), Germany (161) and Canada (137). Councilor Nenette Aguirre-Graf, chair of the Malay municipal council\u2019s tourism committee, said that travel restrictions and quarantine requirements in Hong Kong and China were hindering the arrival of more tourists from these countries, two of Boracay\u2019s main tourist markets.

Before the pandemic, South Korea was the Philippines\u2019 biggest tourist market with 1.98 million visitors in 2019. Since February this year, only 5,551 South Koreans have arrived in the country, the DOT said. Puyat, in a radio interview, said that more South Korean airline carriers were planning chartered flights to the Philippines. She said that many Koreans were keen on visiting popular tourist destinations like Cebu, Boracay and the Clark Freeport. Puyat led the DOT delegation which met with Korean tour operators like Kyowon KRT, Modu Tours and Hana Tours and representatives of government agencies like the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Industry and Energy. The Philippine delegation also met with representatives from the aviation industry, including Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific, Asiana, Air Seoul, T\u2019way, Jin Air, Jeju Air and Fly Gangwon. Puyat pitched the Philippines\u2019 newest tourism products and activities that would likely appeal to the Korean travel market in the new normal.

On Monday, lawyer Jacqueline de Guia, CHR spokesperson, said the commission welcomed the candidates\u2019 pledge to help it fulfill its mandate of protecting human rights. ADVERTISEMENT She expressed the hope that their promise would \u201ctranslate into a commitment that respect for human rights will be an important facet of future actions, policies and overall governance\u201d of the next administration. \u201cFor the past years, we were operating on a limited budget and personnel\u2014not to mention gaps in cooperation\u2014yet we continue[d] to fulfill our mandate to the best of our abilities,\u201d De Guia told the Inquirer when reached for comment.FEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO One less Comelec delay: Precinct finder going online NEWSINFO 6 teens dead, 2 others hurt as van plunges into ravine in Mountain Province NEWSINFO Isko Moreno\u2019s acts would have dismayed Roco, ex-partymates say \u201cWe hope that these statements of support affirm the importance of upholding human rights and dignity for all,\u201d she added. At Sunday\u2019s debate hosted by the Commission on Elections, the candidates agreed to increase the CHR\u2019s budget, which was once threatened by a vicious 2017 campaign at the House of Representatives to slash it down to P1,000, in response to the agency\u2019s criticism and monitoring of the drug war. Then Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez also threatened to completely defund the CHR, claiming that it \u201c[did] not do its job.\u201d Mr. Duterte vetoed in January the establishment of the Human Rights Institute from the CHR\u2019s 2022 budget, citing the lack of a specific appropriation for that purpose. Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who is one of the foremost champions of the CHR and who lobbied for a P678-million budget for the agency, said raising that budget would allow the commission to more effectively carry out its mandate to uphold human rights under the 1987 Constitution. Manila Mayor Francisco \u201cIsko Moreno\u201d Domagoso said that, if elected president, he would make sure to give the commission \u201cample funding\u201d so it can continue its work in investigating human rights abuses, while it also promotes respect for other fundamental rights to food, water, decent housing and quality of life. Vice President Leni Robredo said this might be the reason why people had a poor understanding of human rights, because they think it was \u201cmalayo sa bituka\u201d (far from the gut). ADVERTISEMENT   Former Defense Secretary Norberto Gonzales noted that the CHR \u201cwas put in a very difficult position\u201d under the Duterte administration and suggested that it might be time to assess whether there was a need to increase its authority. For presidential candidate Jose Montemayor Jr., this could mean giving the commission quasijudicial powers, as opposed to its limited mandate of receiving evidence and conducting fact-finding inquiries.

The missile system, however, was not tested for live-firing. (Photo from 94th Army Air and Missile Defense Command) MANILA, Philippines \u2014 The United States has deployed its state-of-the-art air and missile defense system to the Philippines for the first time as part of an annual joint war games and a major display of American force. The US Army in the Pacific carried out the first amphibious insertion of a Patriot missile system \u2014 the first time that the United States deployed the system overseas by land and sea \u2014 in Aparri in the province of Cagayan, located in the northern Philippines facing south of Taiwan. The deployment was apparently meant to showcase the United States\u2019 capabilities to move around the Indo-Pacific region when needed.

Taiwan situation The joint drills also take place as China continues to step up its military activities near Taiwan, which it believes to be part of its territory. Beijing has been regularly flying its military aircraft into Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone, and conducting naval and air drills near the Taiwan Strait, located north of the Philippines. But Koh believes the exercises in Cagayan were not aimed specifically at a Taiwan situation, although he said there was a possible indication that the United States would use the Philippines as potential staging ground for its operations in a Taiwan Strait contingency scenario. He recalled President Duterte\u2019s recent statement allowing American forces to use Philippine bases and facilities if Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine spills over to the region. The 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty binds the Philippines and US to come to the aid of the other in case of an armed attack. \u201cUnder these potential scenarios, the Patriot deployment appears operationally relevant. This is more so considering the Philippines has relatively weak air defenses,\u201d Koh said. Not tested for live-firing The weapon system was transported by the US Navy\u2019s Whidbey Island-class amphibious ship USS Ashland through two landing craft air cushions operated by Naval Beach Unit 7 based in Sasebo, Japan. US Marines from Alpha Company, 9th Engineer Support Battalion, prepared the landing site and ensured the Patriot launchers were able to rapidly move to their fighting positions, the US Army said. ADVERTISEMENT The Patriot\u2014which stands for \u201cPhased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept of Target\u201d\u2014is developed by US weapons manufacturer Raytheon and is currently used by 17 countries. It can track and shoot down attacking missiles and aircraft with a minimum flight time of less than nine seconds and can travel up to 70 kilometers to a target. A typical package consists of radars, missiles, launchers, and support vehicles. The deployment of the Patriot missile defense system to the Philippines was part of a mobilization exercise, but it was not tested for live-firing, according to a senior military official involved in the exercise. Cagayan Gov. Manuel Mamba had earlier opposed live-fire training in joint exercises in his province out of worries that it could offend China, which he saw as a potential major economic investor. Prepare and rehearse responses The US Army\u2019s 94th Army Air and Missile Defense Command said the deployment of Patriot to the Philippines was part of larger amphibious and coastal defense operations throughout the joint drills. \u201cThe Patriot provides critical air defense capabilities and strengthens the ability of the joint and combined force to maintain security across all domains,\u201d it said. Almost 9,000 Filipino and American service members are taking part in the 12-day Balikatan\u2014Filipino word for shoulder-to-shoulder\u2014which ends on April 8. The joint drills are being held as China turns increasingly assertive in the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea, and as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine continues. The annual military exercise between the two allies seeks to ensure interoperability of their forces and to prepare and rehearse their responses to various security threats. \u2018High time\u2019 In the nearby coastal town of Claveria, also in Cagayan province, Filipino and American troops on Thursday acted out to defend an island from potential invaders through beach landings. \u201cIt\u2019s high time, maybe, we never know if we\u2019ll get involved in the unfolding events that we\u2019re hearing about internationally. We don\u2019t know whether we might become involved in them, so at least we\u2019re ready,\u201d Army\u2019s 5th Infantry Division Maj. Gen.

The Marine littoral regiment worked with the Philippine coastal defense regiment to call in simulated strikes from a Marine Corps High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, the report said. The sophisticated long-range missile system was first deployed to Balikatan in 2014. The Balikatan also covers counterterrorism, urban warfare training, maritime security operations, aviation drills, humanitarian projects, and live-fire training in parts of northern and western Luzon.

Businessman Faisal Mangondato chimed in, saying the senator was wrong to claim that political dynasties were okay as long as people kept voting for them. \u201cThat cannot be,\u00a0 because [political dynasties] are the [reason] why politics is being dominated by rich families,\u201d he said. But Pacquiao insisted that banning members of a political clan from running for office would infringe upon their freedoms. \u201cThe Constitution says each one has the right to run in an election. So if you stop them from running, you are preventing them from exercising their right,\u201d he said. Political butterflies The next question on the party system and turncoatism also showed a glimpse into the candidates\u2019 political savvy. Vice President Leni Robredo said she believed that politicians jumping from one party to the next every election \u201cweakens the party system because those running don\u2019t look at what the parties are fighting for and only join them for convenience.\u201d \u201cAs long as we allow turncoatism, we cannot expect to strengthen our political parties. We need a law to strengthen our political parties and force politicians to join parties because of the principles of the party,\u201d she said. Robredo said it might also be high time to revisit whether the current multiparty system was still working for the Filipino people and entertain the possibility of a return to the two-party system. De Guzman agreed that there should be a law against \u201cpolitical butterflies\u201d with a caveat: \u201cMy reservation is that [most parties] have the same agenda and protect the same interests: for capitalists, big business and elitists.\u201d Former defense chief and national security adviser Norberto Gonzales lamented how easy it was for Filipino politicians to switch parties \u201cbecause they don\u2019t understand what parties mean.\u201d \u201cBut if we look at mature democracies, political parties are extremely important, because they represent not only the coming together of politicians but the formation of collective sentiment \u2014 what kind of society do they want to create?\u201d he said. Manila Mayor Francisco \u201cIsko Moreno\u201d Domagoso, who has been criticized for changing parties several times throughout his 24-year career in politics, said it was time for major political reforms in the Philippines. He launched into a summation of his campaign proposals, including the return of the two-party system, the election of the president and the vice president under the same ticket, a regional composition of the Senate, and an overhaul of the party-list system. \u201cAre they (party-list systems) really representing the marginalized? Are they really representing the intent of the law? I think we need to pass another law, through Congress or a people\u2019s initiative, for a change in our political system. It\u2019s high time,\u201d Domagoso said. Human rights The candidates were also asked about their stance on issues affecting the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), the plight of overseas Filipino workers, and regional cooperation. In particular, they were quizzed about their take on human rights violations in other countries, particularly the ongoing military coup in Myanmar. The government must first improve its own human rights situation and global standing before it can even ask other nations, like Myanmar, to observe international treaties on human rights, De Guzman and Pacquiao said, even as other candidates asserted that the Philippines must take the lead in demanding that these nations observe international obligations. Both De Guzman and Pacquiao agreed that the Philippine government must first prove that it respects the rights of Filipinos or it would not have the credibility to speak on such matters. \u201cThe government will not have the moral credibility to speak on such matters if it itself is the prime violator of human rights,\u201d De Guzman said, alluding to the numerous violations flagged under President Duterte\u2019s twin war on drugs and insurgency. \u201cOur country must first have a government that will protect human rights before it can have a standing before Asean nations.\u201d  For Pacquiao, it was hard to make a suggestion \u201cto other countries on issues like this when our own country [does] not have a good image or reputation [before the world].\u201d Lacson and Domagoso, meanwhile, pushed for a more proactive approach to the problem and argued that the Philippines must lead the charge in asking other nations to observe international treatises. \u201cLet\u2019s ask them because we shouldn\u2019t be the only ones asked by other nations all the time to observe our obligations,\u201d Domagoso said, alluding to how several governments and international groups had repeatedly called on the Duterte administration to show respect for human rights locally.

In the Philippines, the number of out-of-school youth rose at the onset of the pandemic from 16.9 percent in January 2020 to 25.2 percent three months later in April 2020, based on a study released by the US Agency for International Development in November 2021. ADVERTISEMENT While various distance learning approaches were implemented and the remote classes were considered a \u201cvictory\u201d by the Department of Education (DepEd), there were at least 1.1 million students who did not enroll for school year 2020 to 2021 due to lack of internet access, among other reasons. The official enrollment at the basic education level reached 27.2 million on Nov. 15, 2021, according to the DepEd\u2019s Learner Information System.FEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO Isko Moreno\u2019s acts would have dismayed Roco, ex-partymates say NEWSINFO Not just bullies, but also \u2018matapobre,\u2019 Isko Moreno says in latest tirade vs Robredo NEWSINFO 6 teens dead, 2 others hurt as van plunges into ravine in Mountain Province This was 3.83 percent higher than the 26.2 million enrollment in the previous school year when the restrictive lockdowns were imposed due to the pandemic. The DepEd said it would release this week the updated number of children who dropped out of school and, in a statement last week, noted that it was working on a \u201clearning recovery plan\u201d intended to address the gaps and challenges brought by the pandemic. In neighboring countries, various measures have been in place such as an early warning system developed in Malaysia to monitor the children at risk of dropping out. Their Ministry of Education also tracks out-of-school youth with the help of local authorities and community leaders. In Thailand, a nationwide effort aimed at identifying children not returning or at risk of not returning to school was also underway, Unicef said. Most vulnerable In other countries such as South Africa, Unicef said the number of out-of-school children tripled from 250,000 to 750,000 between March 2020 and July 2021, while around one in every 10 schoolchildren in Uganda did not return to school in January after a two-year closure. The dropout rate among secondary female students in Malawi, a landlocked country in southeastern Africa, increased from 6.4 percent to 9.5 percent between 2020 and 2021 while in Kenya, 16 percent of girls and 8 percent of the boys among 4,000 survey respondents said they did not return to schools when they reopened. \u201cOut-of-school children are some of the most vulnerable and marginalized children in society. They are the least likely to be able to read, write or do basic math, and are cut off from the safety net that schools provide,\u201d Unicef said in a statement last week. ADVERTISEMENT This puts the out-of-school youth at increased risk of exploitation and a lifetime of poverty and deprivation, the humanitarian organization added. Unicef also noted that with the current \u201cslow learning pace,\u201d most schoolchildren would take seven years to learn basic reading skills and 11 years for foundational numeracy skills, which should have been grasped in two years. As the public health crisis enters its third year, Unicef said that 23 countries catering to around 405 million learners were yet to fully reopen their schools, \u201cwith many schoolchildren at risk of dropping out.\u201d \u201cThis rising inequality in access to learning means that education risks becoming the greatest divider, not the greatest equalizer. When the world fails to educate its children, we all suffer,\u201d said Catherine Russell, Unicef executive director. Reading problem Learning poverty, described by the World Bank as the share of 10-year-olds who cannot read or understand a simple story, has been worsened by two years of school closures due to COVID-19, according to Unicef. In the Philippines, the latest Unicef assessment showed that less than 15 percent of schoolchildren, or about three in every 20, can read simple texts, in large part due to the closure of schools for more than 70 weeks, the longest among 122 countries covered by the Unicef report. This translated to a learning poverty of 85 percent. In 2019, or before the pandemic happened, the rate was 69.5 percent, according to the World Bank. Unicef\u2019s latest joint report with the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) and the World Bank titled \u201cWhere are We on Education Recovery?\u201d showed that schools in the Philippines had been closed from face-to-face classes the longest among the 122 countries covered.  Since the onset of the pandemic in mid-March 2020, only a few schools in the country have returned to in-person instruction and the government had piloted face-to-face schooling in public schools, but in a limited scope as COVID-19 continued to rear its ugly head. \u201cSchoolchildren around the world have missed an estimated two trillion hours \u2014 and counting \u2014 of in-person learning since the onset of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns,\u201d Unicef added. Unicef noted that even before the pandemic more than half of 10-year-olds in low- and middle-income countries were unable to read or comprehend a simple story \u2014 \u201cnow that figure is estimated to be as high as 70 percent.\u201d RELATED STORIES DepEd: Over 10,000 schools OK\u2019d to resume limited in-person classes DepEd eases rules for schools to resume in-person classes Pediatric vaccination \u2018vital\u2019 to reintroduction of in-person classes \u2013 DepEd Read Next Joel Reyes back to reclaim top Palawan seat   EDITORS' PICK DOH: Different vaccine brand as 2nd COVID-19 booster shot \u2018more effective\u2019 Stuck ballot suspends ballot feeding in New York \u2014 PH Consulate General in NY A centralized surveillance system that keeps up with your business growth LTFRB, MMDA blame bus operators over confusion on window-hour scheme CopperMask by JC wins 2022 Reader\u2019s Digest Trusted Brand Award Smart unveils \u2018Free TikTok for all\u2019 with prepaid promos MOST READ One less Comelec delay: Precinct finder going online 6 teens dead, 2 others hurt as van plunges into ravine in Mountain Province Isko Moreno\u2019s acts would have dismayed Roco, ex-partymates say FDA OKs \u2018revolutionary\u2019 anticancer drug Don't miss out on the latest news and information.

Joel Reyes, the principal suspect in the 2011 murder of environmentalist and hard-hitting broadcaster Gerry Ortega, emerged in public for the first time in years on Sunday to campaign for his bid to return to the seat of power in the provincial government. Reyes resurfaced after obtaining a temporary restraining order (TRO) on March 23 from the Supreme Court against the warrant of arrest issued by a Palawan court in July 2021 in connection with the slaying of Ortega, who was gunned down in a thrift shop near his veterinary clinic in this city on Jan. 24, 2011. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cIt was like mission impossible. I never thought or imagine[d] I would ever be able to come back here,\u201d Reyes, the principal accused in the Ortega murder case, said in a speech before his supporters who welcomed him in his residence in the village of Sta.

Dennis Socrates and four other candidates\u2014Art Ventura, Erick Abueg, Richard Lopez and Agapito Salido Jr. Outgoing Gov. Jose Alvarez, who is serving his last term, is running for congressman in the second district of the province. Reyes is accused of masterminding the 11-year-old Ortega murder slay, along with his brother, incumbent Coron Mayor Mario Reyes, who is seeking reelection for his third term. Reyes explained that the Supreme Court decision to issue a TRO was in response to his camp\u2019s motion for reconsideration seeking the \u201clifting of the warrant of arrest and reinstating the [petition for the] dismissal of the case filed at the Court of Appeals (CA).\u201d Petition for review He flew to Puerto Princesa from Metro Manila on Sunday and immediately visited a local church to attend a service as his first appearance in public after his release from detention early last year to serve his sentence for a graft case. Reyes\u2019 legal counsel, lawyer Joaquin Hizon, said they filed a petition for review of the high court\u2019s ruling rejecting the CA\u2019s previous decision to acquit his client of Ortega\u2019s murder. \u201c\u2019Yon yong nakasampa ngayon sa Supreme Court. Habang yon ay pinag-aaralan ng Supreme Court, meron tayong TRO sa korte at sa implementing agencies ng gobyerno (That\u2019s what we have filed in the Supreme Court. While the Supreme Court is reviewing our case, we have a TRO on the court and other implementing agencies of the government),\u201d Hizon said. ADVERTISEMENT In December 2019, the CA set aside its January 2018 ruling that upheld Reyes\u2019 petition questioning the merit of his trial. The CA then reinstated the murder case against Reyes and directed the Palawan regional trial court (RTC) to issue a warrant of arrest against the former governor. However, by then Reyes was already in detention for a graft conviction in a mining case in 2017. He was moved to a jail at Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City in Metro Manila where he remained until his release in April 2021. Ortega was shot multiple times in the head and body by a lone assailant in Puerto Princesa City. The alleged gunman, Marlon Recamata, was caught with the help of bystanders. His alleged accomplices, Dennis Aranas and Armando Noel Loria, were arrested in the following days. Recamata later confessed to the killing and said his group was hired for the hit job in exchange for P150,000 by Rodolfo Edrad Jr., a former Reyes bodyguard. Arrested in Thailand In February 2011, Ortega\u2019s widow, Patria Gloria, filed a murder complaint against Reyes, his brother Mario and 10 others at the Department of Justice (DOJ), saying only Reyes had the motive to order her husband killed. In his daily radio program, Ortega had criticized Reyes for the former governor\u2019s inability to stop the abuses and violations of environmental laws committed by mining companies in Palawan. In March 2012, Reyes and his brother, fled to Vietnam to evade arrest after the DOJ indicted them for Ortega\u2019s murder. After a three-year manhunt, the Reyes brothers were arrested in Phuket, Thailand, in September 2015 and deported to Manila for violating Thai immigration laws. They were eventually detained at the Puerto Princesa City jail. In January 2016, the Supreme Court directed the Palawan RTC to proceed with the trial of Reyes for the murder of Ortega. The RTC denied Reyes\u2019 petition for bail in September 2016. In January 2018, Reyes was released from the Puerto Princesa City jail after the CA upheld his petition questioning the merit of his trial as suspect in the case. But in November 2019, a CA decision penned by Associate Justice Marie Christine Azcarraga-Jacob set aside its January 2018 ruling, reinstating the case and directing the Palawan RTC to issue a warrant of arrest against Reyes.  On July 14, 2021, Judge Angelo Arizala of Branch 52 of the Palawan RTC issued the arrest warrant, nearly two years after the CA reversed its own 2018 decision to dismiss the murder case against Reyes for lack of probable cause. \u2014With REPORTS FROM INQUIRER RESEARCH\u00a0 RELATED STORY 9 years after doctor-radioman Gerry Ortega\u2019s murder, NUJP still pushing for justice Read Next Venezuelan chef makes waves in HK with tacos   EDITORS' PICK Smart unveils \u2018Free TikTok for all\u2019 with prepaid promos CopperMask by JC wins 2022 Reader\u2019s Digest Trusted Brand Award Bongbong Marcos camp posts YouTube video of his accomplishments vivo breaks record, achieves 88% sellout data for the V23 Series 5G LTFRB, MMDA blame bus operators over confusion on window-hour scheme Stuck ballot suspends ballot feeding in New York \u2014 PH Consulate General in NY MOST READ Don't miss out on the latest news and information.

(Photo by GRACE OBERES) CEBU CITY, Cebu, Philippines \u2014 Electricity rates in Metro Cebu are expected to rise this month due to high fuel prices that resulted from the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Engineer Raul Lucero, president and chief operating officer of Visayan Electric, said they were projecting an increase in generation costs as demand for coal in Asia increased. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cAs to how much, we still don\u2019t know. We\u2019re waiting for the billing statement from our suppliers,\u201d he said. Lucero said coal suppliers from Europe, who were heavily affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, were starting to source coal from Asia, particularly in Indonesia, a key supplier for coal-fired plants in the country. The Philippines imports around 75 percent of its coal requirement from Indonesia and Australia.FEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO One less Comelec delay: Precinct finder going online NEWSINFO 6 teens dead, 2 others hurt as van plunges into ravine in Mountain Province NEWSINFO Isko Moreno\u2019s acts would have dismayed Roco, ex-partymates say According to Lucero, Visayan Electric has been trying to find ways to best cushion the impact of the rise of the electricity rates on its consumers. \u201cHopefully, we can manage the increase. One of the solutions we\u2019re considering is to take advantage of the lower prices of WESM (Wholesale Electricity Spot Market) during off-peak [hours],\u201d he said. WESM, created under Republic Act No. 9136, or the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001, is a centralized venue for buyers and sellers to trade electricity as a commodity where prices are determined based on actual demand and supply. Visayan Electric sources its energy requirement from coal-powered plants in the Visayas grid. Of the at least 19 coal-fired plants in the country, five are located in the Visayas. These are Toledo Power Corp. in Toledo City in southwestern Cebu province; Kepco-SPC Power Plant in the City of Naga, south Cebu; Cebu Energy Development Corp., also located in Toledo City; Aboitiz Power-owned Therma Visayas Inc. in Toledo City; and Panay Energy Development Corp. Coal Power Plant in La Paz, Iloilo City. 99-percent restored The projected rate increase came at a time when Metro Cebu, Visayan Electric\u2019s franchise area, was just starting to recover from the devastation wrought by Typhoon \u201cOdette\u201d (international name: Rai), which hit many parts of the Visayas and Mindanao in December last year. The utility company has also just restored electricity in its franchise area, with many of their consumers having to wait for months before they could get their power back. ADVERTISEMENT Lucero said that restoration of power in their franchise area was 99 percent as of Sunday. Only at least a thousand customers in remote mountain villages have no electricity as Visayan Electric has a hard time bringing their equipment and poles to these areas.  Among those that now have electricity were the schools in Metro Cebu that were being eyed as polling centers for the May 9 elections. Lucero said Visayan Electric had guaranteed that power would be available in polling centers three days before and after the May 9 elections. Visayan Electric is the second largest power distributor in the Philippines with over 400,000 subscribers. It covers the cities of Cebu, Mandaue, Talisay, and Naga, and the municipalities of Minglanilla, Liloan, Consolacion, and San Fernando.

The new species was named Begonia francisabuidii after the 25-year-old high school biology teacher who died in a vehicular accident in 2021. ADVERTISEMENT The new begonia species is similar to Begonia madulidii but it is distinguished by shorter and puberulent rhizomes, densely hirsute stipules, reddish and pubescent petiole, smaller leaves, puberulous panicle, smaller bracts and four-tepaled pistillate flower, according to a research published by Taiwania International Journal of Biodiversity on March 28. Research author Cyrus Job dela Cruz said the species resembled the personality of Abuid, as he always wanted to travel far to explore new places riding his bicycle.FEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO Isko Moreno\u2019s acts would have dismayed Roco, ex-partymates say NEWSINFO Not just bullies, but also \u2018matapobre,\u2019 Isko Moreno says in latest tirade vs Robredo NEWSINFO One less Comelec delay: Precinct finder going online \u201cWe discovered B. francisabuidii in a peaceful and far-flung area [in Albay]. It was so inspiring to name it after him because his level of determination to conquer every struggle was the same as when we were looking for francisabuidii,\u201d he said. Dela Cruz said the white flowers that bloomed from the B. francisabuidii species were as \u201cpure as [the] heart and dedication\u201d of Abuid to \u201cinspire young learners to guard and conserve the biodiversity\u201d of the region. \u201cThe white flower represents his kind heart for young researchers who asked help from him for school-related work. He used to accompany these students from sampling to writing research papers,\u201d he said. Critically endangered The research was a collaborative work of Dela Cruz and his coauthors Steven Concepcion from Bicol University and Yu Pin Ang from Philippine Taxonomic Initiative Inc. Dela Cruz is a field biologist of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Bicol and is currently taking a Master of Science in Biodiversity and Environmental Management at Bicol University graduate school in Legazpi City. The species was discovered near Nahulugang-Patok Falls in Barangay Oma-Oma, an upland village in Ligao City. B. francisabuidii is lithophytic and assumed to be highly dependent on moisture. Its flowers bloom during the months of September and November. ADVERTISEMENT Dela Cruz said they considered it critically endangered because of its short dispersal and that they remained isolated in far-flung areas. \u201cWe searched the area for the presence of the population, they were observed growing only in moist shaded rocks near the waterfall. I also can\u2019t find the same in some other areas in Albay,\u201d he said. The species\u2019 population is vulnerable and at risk of decline as the site is frequently visited by local tourists and there is an increase in anthropogenic activities, or environmental damage caused by human activity, added Dela Cruz. RARE BLOOM Begonia francisabuidii, named after Abuid, is a new plant species discovered in Ligao City, Albay province. \u2014PHOTO COURTESY OF CYRUS JOB DELA CRUZ He also cited that the area is not currently protected under the country\u2019s Expanded National Integrated Protected Areas System by the DENR. \u201cWe need to protect this species because it is very unique, it can be considered as a bioindicator. The exploitation of the area could destroy begonia, thus, the possibility of affecting the food chain or food web,\u201d he added. The researcher hoped that the recent discovery would encourage the younger generations to study biodiversity and guard the natural environment. Living memory Carl Josef, brother of Abuid, said they were surprised and honored that one of the dreams of his brother was achieved through his genuine friends. \u201cEven though he is gone, it makes me feel like there\u2019s a piece of him on earth that lives among us and it gives us more reason to remember him and to celebrate the life he lived,\u201d he said. He said his brother loved outdoor activities, researching about conservation of animals and plants, and dreamed of being featured in wildlife-related magazines and television programs. The late biologist\u2019s mother, Francia, said she would want to grow the same species at her son\u2019s grave in Guinobatan town.   \u201cHe may be gone physically but his memory lives in the plants. We are thankful to his friends for naming it after him,\u201d she said. RELATED STORY New flowering plant grows on Mt.
